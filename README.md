## Inspiration 🥬
Choosing where to eat with friends always turns into a long group chat of “I don’t care, you pick” followed by indecision, missed messages, and last-minute changes. We wanted to build something that makes planning meals easy. LettuceEat was inspired by the everyday struggle of turning cravings into real plans.

## What it does 📅
LettuceEat lets users browse restaurants, see menus, reviews, and how each place stacks up against its competitors. Once a restaurant is chosen, users can create an event, invite friends, check everyone’s availability, and automatically find the best time and date. When the plan is set, everyone gets notified!

## How we built it 🔨
Built with React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Yellowcake API, Gemini API, and lots of love <3

## Challenges we ran into 🥊
Connecting the frontend and backend smoothly was one of our biggest challenges. We also ran into a lot of issues getting the desired data from web scraping

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We're proud to have built a working end-to-end system that solves a common daily problem for university students! We would all personally enjoy using this app in our everyday lives.

## What we learned ✨
We learned how to design full-stack systems, manage APIs, and handle real-world data issues. We got better at debugging, collaborating under time pressure, and turning rough ideas into working features.

## What's next for LettuceEat 🤔
Next, we want to add a “Favourite Restaurants” feature so users can save their favourite spots and also see what their friends love! It would also be great if we could support dietary preferences and budgets. We want LettuceEat to become the go-to app for turning “Where should we eat?” into a plan in seconds.
